# 3D Cityscape From a 2D Top-View Image
## Libraries required to run the code 
vpython, cv2, numpy

## How to install vpython
Write pip install vpython==7.6.3 in the terminal.

## How to run the program
Type python project.py in the terminal

If using lab computers to run the code, the code needs to run from inside a virtual environment.

## Steps to create and use a virtual enviroment
1. Open the terminal in linux
2. Type python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
3. This creates the virtual environment with the name venv
4. To open the virtual environment, type source venv/bin/activate
5. Now the terminal will show (venv) in the start. This means that you are now inside the virtual environment.
6. Now go to the directory the file is in from here and run the python program by typing python project.py

## How to use the program
1. The program will ask for a map image to read. We have uploaded some samples to github. sample1.png, sample2.png, sample3.png will work for this. campus.png is the image for the campus map. Images can also be created in MS Paint using the colours corresponding to each element.
2. The program will ask if you want an underground system. If you do, type y and press enter. Otherwise, type n.
3. If you answered y, the program will ask for an underground map. munnels.png is the map of the munnels.
4. The 3D model will pop up in a browser window.
   - You can view it at different angles by right-clicking the model and moving the mouse or sliding on the trackpad.
   - You can drag the model by holding shift and left-clicking the model and moving the mouse or sliding on the trackpad.
   - You can zoom-in or zoom-out by scrolling up or down using the scroll wheel or sliding your fingers away from or towards each other on the trackpad.
